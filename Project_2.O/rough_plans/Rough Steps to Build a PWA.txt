Rough Steps to Build Your PWA:
Create your web app â€” HTML/CSS/JS or whatever framework (React, Vue, etc.).

Add a manifest.json with app name, icons, theme color, etc.

Register a service-worker.js for caching and offline features.

Serve over HTTPS (PWAs need a secure connection).

Add a <link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json"> in your HTML.

(Optional) Add extra stuff like push notifications.
